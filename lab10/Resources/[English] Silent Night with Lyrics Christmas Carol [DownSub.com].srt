00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,660


2
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:29,000
Silent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Round yon virgin mother and child, holy infant so tender and mild

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace.

5
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:18,000
Silent night, holy night! Shepherds quake at the sight

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:31,880
Glories stream from heaven afar, heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!

7
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:47,000
Christ, the saviour is born, Christ the saviour is born.

8
00:01:50,580 --> 00:02:05,000
Silent night, holy night! Son of God love's pure light,

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:19,660
Radiant beams from thy holy face with the dawn of redeeming grace,

10
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:34,000
Jesus, lord, at thy birth. Jesus, lord, at thy birth.

11
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Silent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright,

12
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:07,120
Round yon virgin mother and child, holy infant so tender and mild,

13
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:22,000
Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace.
